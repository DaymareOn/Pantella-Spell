# Pantella Spell
> Bring Skyrim NPCs to life with AI

This repository is for the Pantella Spell mod, which handles the Skyrim-side logic of Pantella. For the main Pantella repository, see [here](https://github.com/art-from-the-machine/Mantella).

The source code for the subtitles plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/swwu/Mantella-Subtitles-Plugin-NG).

The .esp is converted to version-control-friendly .yaml files using [Spriggit](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Spriggit).

The SkyUI SDK is required to work with MCM menu code, which can be found [here](https://github.com/schlangster/skyui/wiki).

# How to Install

I do not recommend manually installing the mod, instead please use the [launcher](https://github.com/Pathos14489/Pantella-Launcher). However if you must, all the scripts on this repo are precompiled, merely download by clcking the Code button, then Download ZIP. The zip downloaded will contain the mod plugin. Install it however you wish.
